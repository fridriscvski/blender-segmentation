*Semantic Segmentation of Weeds using PyTorch*

Introduction
This repository contains a project focused on semantic segmentation of weeds using PyTorch. The dataset includes both real images and images from a digital twin simulation. The goal is to accurately identify and segment weeds to improve agricultural practices.

The project leverages advanced deep learning techniques and integrates synthetic data from 3D simulations to enhance the model's performance. This approach allows for better generalization and robustness when dealing with various real-world conditions.
